Ripple is based on the slitscan video experiment, a neat technique where each slice of video is slightly delayed from the one next to it.

Click on the "?" for keyboard shortcuts, there are a bunch of different ways it can slice time.

No video or images are saved anywhere, just briefly kept in browser memory while being processed.

Make reality glitchy!
